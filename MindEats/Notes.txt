Enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. Will take a few days for the enrollment to process. Immediate goal is to distribute the app on Testflight and get it to the rest of the team.

Added the signup page. Simplified navigation logic, I got rid of the selector in ContentView and am just using navigationlinks for everything. Added a basic meal view with dummy meals.
    1) Change this to pull meals from JSON, eventually lazy load from server.
